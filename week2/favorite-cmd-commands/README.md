#**My Favorite cmd-commands**

## 1. **ls -List directory contents**

ls is probably the most common command. A lot of times, you’ll be working in a directory and you’ll need to know what files are located there. The ls command allows you to quickly view all files within the specified directory.

Syntax: `ls` [option(s)] [file(s)]

Common options: -a, -l

## 2. **echo — Prints text to the terminal window**

prints text to the terminal window and is typically used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a computer file. Echo is also particularly useful for showing the values of environmental variables, which tell the shell how to behave as a user works at the command line or in scripts.

Syntax: `echo` [option(s)] [string(s)]

Common options: -e, -n

## 3. **pwd — Print working directory**

pwd is used to print the current directory you’re in. As an example, if you have multiple terminals going and you need to remember the exact directory you’re working within, then pwd will tell you.

Syntax: `pwd` [option(s)]
Common options: options aren’t typically used with pwd
